    <h2 class = second> Introduction </h2>
    <p> Hello! I am Brenden Kelley, I am 22 years old and currently in my Junior year of a physics and secondary education degree. 
        My family comes from different walks of life but my parents met while they were in boot camp. 
        I want to become a physics teacher because physics and math click with me completely and I want to be able to bring that to people who aren't quite there yet.
    </p>
    <h2> What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
    <ul class="squarelist">
        <li>Learning the process behind computer science to use in different applications.</li>
        <li>Learning basic coding languages to help with personal projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> My Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p> My favorite hobby is tabletop RPGs. Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Warhammer RPGS, I like all of them. Tabletop RPGs allow me to be creative and write my own stories in some of my favorite genres.
        The fact that they are run by a human being, reacting to your decisions also makes almost everything possible. Currently I am playing in a couple of Dungeons and Dragons campaigns and my characters in both couldn't be more different
        One of them is a researcher with only basic combat training who's only adventuring to write a book, the other is an evil worshipper of an evil god. 
    </p>
